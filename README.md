## Overview

The YouTube Music Redirect Extension is a browser extension designed to enhance the user experience for non-premium subscribers of YouTube Music. By default, when non-premium users try to access YouTube Music, they are redirected to the premium subscription page and cannot listen to music. This extension intercepts the redirection and instead directs non-premium users to a normal YouTube video.

## Features

- Redirect interception: Prevent non-premium users from being redirected to the premium subscription page when accessing YouTube Music.
- Seamless experience: Users can enjoy their music without being directed to an annoying premium subscription page.
- Compatibility: Premium subscribers can use YouTube Music in the extension without interruption.
